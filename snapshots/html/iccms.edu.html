		2012 graduates in Itawamba Community College&#39;s five-county district are encouraged to apply for the County Guaranteed Tuition programs before the July 31 deadline.<br><br>Students in Chickasaw, Itawamba, Lee, Monroe and Pontotoc counties should meet several requirements, according to Bob Walker, ICC director of financial aid.<br><br>They include<br>Take the National American College Test (National ACT) by June 9.<br><br>Apply for Mississippi Tuition Assistance Grant (MTAG) at www.mississippi.edu by July 31. Students can check on the status of their MTAG application by returning to the website.<br><br>Apply for ICC institutional scholarships at www.iccms.edu/forms by July 31.<br><br>Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.ed.gov by July 31.<br><br>Complete the County Guaranteed Tuition application by July 31. Applications are available and accepted between Jan. 1 and July 31 each year.<br><br>Chickasaw, Itawamba, Lee and Pontotoc graduates must enroll as a full-time student (at least 12 academic hours) at ICC for the fall semester following graduation from high school or after completing a military obligation if the individual enters the military immediately following high school graduation or after earning the GED certificate for all counties except for Lee County.<br><br>Monroe County applicants must enroll as a full-time student (at least 12 academic hours) at ICC for the fall semester following their application to the MCGTP. They are not required to be recent high school graduates or GED recipients. Applicants can only apply once, and eligibility is for four consecutive semesters. Once eligibility is lost, it cannot be regained.<br><br>Walker said that if the above requirements are met, eligibility will be determined by totaling the amount of aid received by other sources (Federal, state, institutional, etc.). If the cost of tuition has not been met, the county grant will be awarded up to the cost of tuition. Lee and Monroe County recipients will be awarded up to $1,400 per semester. Applicants whose awards do not exceed $1,400 per semester will then be awarded CGTP funds to cover the difference. Any amount over $1,000 for tuition must be used for textbooks in the ICC Bookstore. Student loans, work-study and MPACT are not included in the calculation. Recipients must pass a minimum of 12 credit hours each semester with a 2.0 GPA to continue eligibility.<br>Walker said that students who receive full academic scholarships to ICC should also apply for the county guaranteed tuition program. &quot;If something happens after the fall semester and students are no longer eligible for academic scholarships in the spring, it&#39;s possible that they may receive county tuition assistance for the spring if they passed 12 hours with a 2.0 GPA if they applied by the July 31 deadline.&quot;<br><br>For more information, contact Walker at (662) 862-8223 or e-mail rdwalker@iccms.edu.<br><br><br>

		Highlighting the critical importance of improving student success in America&#39;s community colleges, the Aspen Institute College Excellence Program today named Itawamba Community College as one of the nation&#39;s 120 top community colleges, challenging it to compete for the $1 million fund for the 2013 Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence. The Aspen Institute identified the 120 community colleges &45; 10 percent of all institutions &45; using a quantitative formula that assesses performance and improvement in four areas: graduation rates, degrees awarded, student retention rates and equity in student outcomes.<br><br>These colleges will now compete for the prestigious honor following a year-long research process into how well their students learn, complete degrees and get jobs with competitive wages after graduating. A full list of the 120 community colleges is available at www.AspenCCPrize.org. Prize winners will be announced in March 2013.<br><br>The inaugural Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence was awarded to the 70,000 &45;student Valencia College (Orlando, Fla.) in December 2011. It was the first broad national recognition of extraordinary accomplishments at individual community colleges.<br><br>Some seven million students &45; youth and adult learners &45; enroll in America&#39;s nearly 1,200 public and private community colleges every year.<br><br>&quot;The success of our nation&#39;s community colleges is more important than ever before,&quot; said Aspen Institute College&#39;s Excellence Program Executive Director Josh Wyner, who announced the names of the 120 top community colleges at the annual convention of the American Association of Community Colleges in Orlando, Fla. &quot;At a time when a college degree is essential to entering the middle class, community colleges like Itawamba Community College offer the most promising path to education and employment for literally millions of Americans. This competition spotlights excellence, and we encourage Itawamba Community College to apply for the nation&#39;s top community college prize to raise the bar for all community colleges to improve student achievement and better prepare the next generation for the job market after college.&quot;<br><br>ICC and 119 other community colleges will be winnowed to eight-to-10 finalists in September based on how much students learn, how many complete their programs on time and how well students do in the job market after graduating.<br><br>Itawamba Community College is now eligible to submit an application containing detailed data on these criteria. It must demonstrate that it delivers exceptional student results, uses data to drive decisions and continually improves over time.<br><br>The Aspen Institute will conduct site visits to each of the finalists in the fall. A distinguished prize jury co-chaired by John Engler, president of Business Roundtable, former Michigan Governor and former president of the National Association of Manufacturers and Richard Riley, former South Carolina Governor and U.S. Secretary of Education, will select a grand prize winner and four runners-up to be announced in March 2013.<br><br>&quot;American employers have jobs open right now but lack enough skilled, educated workers to fill them,&quot; Engler said. &quot;The job training programs at community colleges must play a central role in filling those gaps and preparing the American workforce. Community colleges&#39; success will help determine whether and in what sectors America will continue to lead in the global economy.&quot;<br><br>While every community college faces challenges, particularly in today&#39;s economic climate, Secretary Riley underscored the importance of improving outcomes for community college students, the majority of whom are underrepresented minorities. &quot;Many community colleges across this country are doing an excellent job of boosting student success, but we need to encourage all community colleges to achieve excellence. When students learn more, graduate or transfer to four-year institutions and get competitive-wage jobs after college, it helps everyone &45; students, employers and our nation&#39;s economy as a whole.&quot;<br><br><br>

		Itawamba Community College is partnering with East Central Community College in a pilot Community Colleges in Training Grant program.<br><br>Fifteen participants, who are enrolled in the first class at ICC-Belden, are working toward a Certified Production Technician designation offered by the Manufacturing Skill Standards Council. The credential is a nationally portable certificate that validates skill standards common to all progressive manufacturers, according to Denise Gillespie, Workforce Development and Training team leader.<br><br>The first two modules of the certification, Safety and Manufacturing Processes and Production, are the focus of the current class, which began this week.<br><br>&quot;This class is allowing us to pilot two different concepts: training delivery through video conferencing and the idea of national credentials for production workers,&quot; Gillespie said.<br><br>Videoconferencing allows several colleges to share training resources. &quot;Through video conference delivery, we don&#39;t have to have 10 students in one location to make a class,&quot; according to Gillespie. &quot;We can have small classes at multiple locations, use one instructor and be able to deliver the training in a timely manner.&quot;<br><br>Manufacturing is one of the largest employment sectors in Mississippi, and advanced skill production workers are critical to the sustainability and growth of this sector, Gillespie said. &quot;Through the MSSC&#39;s Certified Production Technician program, students can obtain a national credential through local sources. These portable, industry-recognized credentials will improve and validate the skills of Mississippi workers, which could also be of great value when recruiting new companies.&quot;<br><br>Instructors from East Central, which is the lead college, broadcast the same class, live, twice each week, on Tuesdays from 5-8 p.m. and Thursdays, from 2-5 p.m. Students may choose which day and time slot works best for them to participate in the eight-week class at ICC-Belden. Their final assessment test will be administered in Philadelphia, Miss.<br><br>Students receive complete sets of printed study materials, access to online instructional modules, access to practice tests and pre-paid vouchers for the assessment tests. Additional modules of the certification are Quality Practices and Measurement and Maintenance Awareness.<br> <br>Currently participating in the class are employees of General Atomics, Toyota Boshoku, Lane Furniture and Tecumseh.<br><br>Dates for future classes are being discussed, Gillespie said.<br><br><br><br>
