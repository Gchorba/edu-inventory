			<p class="date2">June<b>29</b></p><p>You do not have to be seeking a degree to take courses at Miami Christian University. Many students take just a course or two. Some register for courses for personal interest, and some for transfer into a degree program at MCU at a later date.</p>

If you want credit for the courses you take, you will need to have your work graded, and then officially apply for enrollment in the university before credit can be applied.</p>
