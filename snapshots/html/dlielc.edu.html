Showcasing cultural displays from 23 countries, the Defense Language Institute English Language Center (DLIELC) held its first International Fest Feb. 1 at the Gateway Club.
	 Students attending DLIELC&acute;s Advanced English Studies here created the displays, each showcasing their cultural customs and traditions.
	 Each display included facts about the country with printed photos, computer slides, and videos with personal narration.  Sudents conducted presentations featuring origami, music and dance instructions.
	 More than 1,000 people from the base and nearby local communities attended the event, which included 4th and 6th graders from Lackland Elementary School, as well as volunteers from the American Members of International Goodwill to Others programs, commonly referred to as the AMIGO program.
	 Event Coordinator, Milissa Stewart from the DLIELC&acute;s Field Studies Program Division, coordinated the effort, recruiting students and support for the Fest over the course of four months.
	 &quot;Students were eager to participate and went above and beyond expectations for the event,&quot; said Steward.  &quot;We held this first-time DLIELC event to showcase our school to the base and local community.  I feel we successfully achieved our objective.&quot;
	 One of the primary reasons for the event was to attract more sponsors to the AMIGO program, which pairs volunteers with students during their English language training, and to acquaint students with American society, customs and way of life.
	 &quot;This first-time endeavor successfully provided a new awareness of DLIELC for those who did not know of the school&acute;s existence on base, and also served as a perfect recruiting tool for our American Members of the AMIGO volunteer sponsorship program,&quot; she added.
	 One presented, Paraguayan Army Lt. Col. Miguel Escurra, said, &quot;This was a great opportunity to show and tell people about my country, its location, our national dress, especially about my national tea, &acute;mato&acute;, which I&acute;m asked about every day.&quot;
	 &quot;I&acute;m thrilled with the interest and turnout the Lackland community showed for our first international fest,&quot; said Col. James Garrett, DLIELC Commandant.  &quot;This was a fantastic opportunity for our international students to showcase their nations and culture to our local community.&quot;

Garrett directs a DLIELC program that provides on-campus English language training to military and civilian leaders from more than 110 countries annually. The new commandant also oversees English language training at an average of 30 overseas nonresident locations around the world. As the Gateway to America for all its international students, DLIELC also provides a comprehensive American cultural immersion experience through a program of trips, excursions and community interactive projects.	  </p>

	 <H1>Voodoo (F101) finds home at DLI!</H1>
      <p>The F-101 Voodoo static display aircraft was delivered from a location near the Lackland AFB Security Forces Museum to the DLI campus on Oct 22.  The aircraft is now displayed on the campus behind Bldg 7445, Sebille Hall. This building was named after Maj. Louis Sebille, the commander of the 67th Fighter- Bomber Squadron. In the Korean War, Sebille sacrificed his life during a air-strike mission by deliberately crashing his heavily damage P-51 Mustang into an enemy convoy.  The F-101 Voodoo is appropriately displayed next to the campus building because Sebille‟s unit tactical reconnaissance mission added the model and the unit flew the aircraft after his death.  DLI will hold an static display ceremony for the aircraft on Nov 16 at 1330 at the campus flagpoles.

      <H1>DLI student gets a personal view of the “real” Army and an American family’s home</H1>
     <p>By Annette D. Janetzke<br>

How does the U.S. Army compare with Iraq’s Army and how does the American family interact in their home?  "I would welcome a chance to view the largest U.S. Army base, stay in an American home and share a meal with the family, this is a dream come true for me," said 1st Lt Samer from the Iraqi Army.  He arrived in February and is studying English at the Defense Language Institute English Language Center.  He celebrated his promotion to 1st Lt on July 15th.<p>  

Fulfillment of Samer’s dream became possible while he was working in Iraq as the Platoon Commander for the Brigade Company and meeting Capt Benjamin Johnston, who was his training advisor.  They formed a bond from their working relationship which turned into a lasting friendship.  He was singled out by Johnston who said, “I was impressed with his motivation and adaptation in military bridging as well as Samer’s leadership.” <p> 

Back in the States, Johnston kept in touch with him and upon Samer’s arrival to DLI, and visited him “just to hang out,” he said.  Maj. Trey Birdwell was the Iraqi Army Headquarters Field Engineer Regiment Adviser, Training Assistant—Equipment, Officer-in-Charge.  Both are now working at Fort Hood.  The two gentlemen talked and expressed a desire to host Samer at Fort Hood, as their Brigades were partners with the Iraqi troop training.  Johnston worked at gaining permission from DLI’s command for a short visit to the Army base, and it was granted. <p> 

Invitation secured, Samer prepared a briefing to present to Col. Kent Savre, outgoing commander for 36th Engineer Brigade, Fort Hood.  After the change of command, he met with Savre and shared his message of gratitude for the partnership and relationship established with Iraq which continues today.   Samer gave a gift to Savre, the Lion of Babylon, in return received the brigade commander’s coin and regiment insignia.<p>

With the ceremony complete, he was then whisked away by Johnston, for an hour long windshield tour of Fort Hood, viewing its massive area, countless pieces of equipment, and training facilities.  “Being the largest U.S. military post, he gained a new appreciation and understanding of the U.S. Army’s operation,” stated Johnston. <p> 

Then a “one-on-one” cultural experience began with an invitation to stay 2 nights with Johnston.  Samer and his host, Johnston, spent an evening with Birdwell and his family.  Johnston stated that, “this experience of staying in an American home, eating dinner with a family and interacting with a typical American household—their children, pets, photo albums—was a  huge lesson in culture, which fosters a relationship and partnership long term, developing respect for each one’s life role.”   Johnston hopes other DLI students will have a similar opportunity.<p>

Samer  is not finished with his education which includes a B.S. in physics from the Baghdad University and a B.S. in military science from Baghdad Military College.  He said he wants to pursue his Master's degree in science.

<H1>Adayana Develops Immersive Learning Solution To Teach U.S Culture To International Students
</H1><p>Submitted by Rosemarie Kelly on August 10, 2011 - 3:50pm <br>

<strong>FALLS CHURCH, Va.</strong> – Adayana Government Group, an organizational performance optimization company, announced today it was awarded a contract and completed implementation of a computer-based, immersive learning solution to teach U.S. cultural norms to foreign military personnel studying at the Defense Language Institute English Language Center (DLIELC) at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. <p>

The solution, called VALIDATE (Voice-Activated Learning in Direct-Applied Training & Education), is an interactive 3D game that creates U.S. cultural awareness and embeds language practice. VALIDATE features culturally smart avatars that require voice-activated responses as students work their way through 12 customized scenarios in a virtual world mirroring everyday locations and interactions.<p>

The course goal is to expose foreign personnel to culturally specific behaviors encountered in the normal course of a day in the U.S. and to require verbal responses to practice speaking English. Students will experience what’s considered an appropriate response so they learn how to be more effective in their daily operations.<p>

Each scenario requires students to interact with avatars and master an aspect of American or U.S. military culture. Examples include no smoking in public areas, engaging in small talk with others, effective negotiating, recognizing proper U.S. military protocol, and identifying culturally inappropriate questions, such as how old a person is or how much money a person makes. The avatars also speak in various regional accents that students must recognize and speak answers to using grammatically correct responses. VALIDATE is the first immersive learning endeavor for DLIELC, a Department of Defense agency founded in 1954 that trains up to 3,300 students a year from 116 different countries.<p>

“Adayana has delivered a superb product that brings our vision of a culture-based game with embedded language practice to a reality,” said DLIELC Chief of Innovation and Institutional Development Sally Carter. The school’s commandant, Col. Howard Jones, added, “Students have enthusiastically embraced the new learning technology. Avatar technology will play a unique role in our highly cross-culture environment.”<p>

The project also stretched the innovative talents of Adayana, an industry leader in developing and delivering learning solutions for government clients for more than 15 years. VALIDATE gave Adayana the opportunity to deliver its most customized immersive learning solution to date with multiple branching levels and the use of voice-recognition software.<p>

 “Adayana believes immersive learning solutions are better suited to change the way learners think and how they behave than traditional learning modalities,” said Jeff Kidwell, Adayana Government Group president.  “We are excited to support the U.S. Air Force and DLIELC by creating this leading-edge immersive learning solution.”<p>

A Georgian Army offi cer studying at
the Defense Language Institute’s English
Language Center used his medical
training to help save the life of a civilian
employee recently at the DLI campus.
On Aug. 2 at approximately 7:45
p.m., Army Capt. Aliko Odilavadze
stopped by the Gateway Lodge Sundry
Store to purchase a snack and soft
drink. When he went to the counter to
pay for his purchases, Odilavadze notice
the cashier, Linda Blount, appeared
disoriented; her lips were pale.
He asked Blount, “Are you okay?”
Blount replied, “No, I feel sick.”
Seeing Blount lean back against the
wall behind her for balance, the captain
and Andrew Pineda, another store employee,
helped Blount to a chair next to
the cashier’s counter.
Using his medical expertise, Odilavadze
took Blount’s pulse and discovered
it was very weak.
He asked her how she felt, but a
disoriented Blount responded with an
unclear answer.
Odilavadze asked Blount, “Are you
diabetic?” She answered, “Yes.” Next,
he asked, “Do you have a blood sugar
monitor?” Blount answered, “No.”
Suddenly, Blount became nauseated
and blacked out for about 20 seconds.
Odilavadze knew she was going into
diabetic shock, so he had Pineda call
emergency medical services for assistance.
Blount needed immediate medical
attention.
The captain stayed alongside Blount
asking her questions to keep her responsive
and alert. He placed a cold,
damp cloth on her forehead to keep
her cool.
After about 10 minutes, EMS personnel
arrived and took over the medical
emergency.
Inquiring about her medical condition
the next day, Odilavadze was told
by a front desk employee at DLI’s Gateway
Inn that Blount remained hospitalized
and under observation.
Reunited Aug. 25 at the store where
it all began, Blount told the captain,
“God bless you for helping me; you
were my guardian angel that day. You
saved my life.”
A humble Odilavadze replied by saying
he was just doing his job. He is just
glad that as a medical physician, he
was able to assist Blount during her
medical crisis.
Odilavadze remains at the DLIELC
attending a specialized english course.
In October, he will move on to Fort Sam
Houston where he will attend the fourmonth-
long Medical Captain Career
Course in Radiology.<p>

<p>2/12/11 - <strong>TAJI, Iraq (AFNS) </strong> -- As you walk into the Iraqi Air Force Training School here you will notice the words integrity, military discipline, loyalty to the homeland and English language posted on the walls. These are the Iraqi Air Force core values.<BR>
<p>Airmen, civilians and contractors assigned to the 821st Expeditionary Training Squadron educate, train, advise and assist the faculty and students at the training school in an effort to build the foundation of a credible, self-sustaining Iraqi Air Force.
<p>While air advisors work with the faculty to help them improve the way the overall program is run, it is the 19 U.S. contractors and lone government civilian from the Defense Language Institute English Language Center at Lackland who work faceto-face with the students.  Those 20 instructors teach a student body of more than 200 Iraqis.  “Mastering the English language is a key to the future success of Iraqi Air Force operations,” said Lt. Col. Dawn Nickell, 821st ETRS commander.</p>
<p>English holds such a high priority because it is the internationally recognized language standard for aviation.</p>
<p>In addition to satisfying the Iraqi Air Force’s fourth core value, learning English is a requirement before Iraqi airmen can take other technical training courses. For example, pilots can’t speak to air traffi c controllers without some level of English language training.</p>
<p>“The English language is the language of the world,” said the Iraqi Air Force Training School commandant. “We must learn this language to improve our skills.”</p>
<p>The ELT at the Iraqi Air Force Training School is based on the Defense Language Institute’s program for teaching the English language.  DLI is a Department of Defense educational and research institution, which provides linguistic and cultural instruction to the DOD, other federal agencies and numerous other customers – such as Iraq.</p>
<p>The program here consists of 36 books and can take up to 12 months to complete. All students must take a profi ciency test to determine their entry-level skill before starting the training.</p>
<p>“After the students take their placement exam, we place them in the appropriate book for their skill level and then assign them a teacher,” said Maj. Korey Vaughn, 821st  ETRS, ELT chief.</p>
<p>To date, 28 students have completed the training, which has seen many improvements since the existing ELT program started in October 2010.  The program has seen an increase in attendance, and air advisors have turned over all ELT materials to Iraqi control. However, the school is looking to make more changes and become more self-sufficient.</p>
<p>“We are looking for the English Language Training to get even better in the future,” said the school’s commandant. “We would like to start using Iraqi instructors instead of contractors from the United States.”</p>
