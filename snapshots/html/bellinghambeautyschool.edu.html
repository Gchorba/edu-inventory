				<h2><span class="comment">Our Philosophy</span></h2>
				<p>"Every decision we make about this School; from setting the Student Dress Code, to inviting visiting Guest Artists; from selecting Coaches who'll help prepare Students for Competition, to providing Wi-Fi access for Students' laptop computers - whether it be a rule, a class, an activity, or a convenience - absolutely everything exists only if we can answer "Yes" to either of these two questions:.</p>
				<p>1)	Will it help the Student Pass the WA State Examinations? or,.</p>
				<p>2)	Will it help the Student become successful as a working Cosmetologist?</p>
