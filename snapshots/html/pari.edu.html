<p><strong>May 5th SPACE DAY - PARI's Annual Open House</strong></p>
<p>Nearly 200 visitors came to PARI on Saturday, May 5th to attend our annual SPACE DAY open house. Click <a href="about_pari/pari-photos/archived-photos/space-day-photos/2012-space-day-photos">PHOTOS</a> to see pictures from the event. Visitors toured our exhibit gallery, attended StarLab shows, talked with scientists and other astronomers and viewed many exhibits around the campus. The threatening weather cooperated and provided wonderful views of the Sun through the Cleveland Astronomy Club's solar telescopes. Visitors heard a talk by Dr. Bob Hayward on the upcoming Transit of Venus and saw the exciting research begin done in our Astronomical Photographic Data Archive.

<p>The long awaited remounting of the completely refurbished feedboxes with the two matching feeds was accomplished on Tuesday, December 13th. Click <a href="about_pari/pari-photos/archived-photos/site-engineering-work/december-13-2011-26-meter-antenna-feedboxes-reinstalled">PHOTOS</a> to see pictures of the process. The core team led by Ben Goldsmith, Thad McCall and John Halsey with help from Donnie Curto and Brad McCall coordinated the engineering feat of lifting and installing the loaded (1,500+ lbs) feedboxes into the frames at the focal points of the massive radio antennas. The feedboxes have been fully redesigned and refurbished by the NSF-Sponsored team which was led by University of North Carolina Asheville's Dr. Brian Dennison and Dr. Chuck Bennett. The next step is now the commissioning of the two antennas into an interferometer, making this one of the finest instruments of its kind.</p>

<p><strong>PARI Receives Another Significant Astronomical Photographic Plate Collection</strong></p>
<p>Scott Leonard and Gary Walker from the Nantucket Maria Mitchell Observatory (MMO) delivered a collection of more than 8,000 astronomical photographic plates to PARI on Thursday, November 17th.

PARI staff and volunteers helped unload and file the plates. The collection includes images taken since 1913. The fact that MMO chose to locate this collection here is further evidence of how PARI and APDA are gaining reputation in the field.

Brandt, in collaboration with Mal Niedner and Jurgen Rahe, was very active in the Large-Scale Phenomena Network of the International Halley Watch. In the course of the project, he moved from Goddard Space Flight Center to the University of Colorado. The results were two archives of the images collected in 1985-1986. Some of these images were published in their ATLAS.</p>
