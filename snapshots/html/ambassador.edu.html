University, founded as Ambassador College in 1947, was a privately
supported Christian university in the liberal arts tradition,
incorporated in the State of Texas. <p>The University first began operations at Pasadena, California, as <br>
Ambassador College, a unit of the Worldwide Church of God.&nbsp; A
second campus opened in 1960 at Bricket Wood, St. Albans,
Hertsfordshire in the United Kingdom.&nbsp; Four years later a third
campus commenced operations in Big Sandy, Texas.&nbsp; As graduates
began outnumbering employment opportunities within the Worldwide Church
of God, the campuses consolidated in Pasadena: Bricket Wood in 1974,
and Big Sandy in 1977.</p>
<p>In August 1981, to meet increasing enrollment demands, the Big Sandy campus reopened.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In
the fall of 1990, Ambassador College, at Pasadena and Big Sandy,
consolidated operations in Texas.&nbsp; In 1994 the college became
Ambassador University and was granted full accredited status by the
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. </p>
<p>Ambassador
concluded its mission to liberal arts education in August of 1997,
having awarded 9,362 degrees, closing its doors as a fully accredited
institution.</p>
<p>For 14,732 young men and women, over 50 years,
Ambassador has been instrumental in the preparation of lives of service
to Jesus Christ and His church.&nbsp; Its students and faculty continue
to be &#8220;Ambassadors for Christ.&#8221;</p></td>
