                            </h2>
<p align="left">The founding of a Bible college to   prepare young men and women for an in-depth, Spirit-filled ministry has   been Brother Swaggart's dream for a number of years. He has felt such an   institution will play an important role in evangelizing the world as   the coming of Christ draws near.</p>
                                <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                                <p align="left">&quot;We don't have much   time left,&quot; says Brother Swaggart. &quot;We must do everything within our   power to reach a lost and dying world with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.   All our energies and all of our resources must be utilized in this   battle we're waging for men's souls. That includes equipping young men   and women to carry on until Jesus calls us home.&quot;</p>
                                <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">As a result of this   vision, World Evangelism Bible College opened in the fall of 1984, and   the seminary opened in the fall of 1988.</p>
                                <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                            <p align="left">The goal of World   Evangelism Bible College is to build students into kind of men and women   God wants them to be. From its doors the college is sending   missionaries, evangelists, pastors, and teachers to all the world.</p>
                                <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                                <p align="left">The entire lifestyle   of World Evangelism Bible College is based on a scriptural foundation.   This life-style is stressed in each class, and a daily walk with Christ   is emphasized in every facet of each individual's life who is associated   with the college.</p>
                            <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                                <p align="left">World Evangelism   Bible College accepts only those students who feel God's call upon their   lives to prepare them to go into the harvest fields that &quot;are white   already to harvest&quot; (John 4:35).</p>
                                <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                                <h2><strong>A DYNAMIC PENTECOSTAL ATMOSPHERE</strong></h2>
                                <p><br />
                                  WEBC was birthed through the ministry of Jimmy  Swaggart.  The distinct emphasis of  Brother Swaggart is the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and it is this ongoing  principle upon which the college was founded and continues to operate.  From the daily chapel service with its lively  worship of God, to the classrooms, to the residence halls, the entire campus is  dedicated to walking in the Spirit of God.</p>
                                <p><br />
                                  Here at WEBC, Chapel is often referred to as the  classroom of the Holy Spirit.  Under the  ministry of Brother Swaggart, Spirit-filled professors, visiting speakers, and  upperclassmen, the Word of God is illuminated by the Holy Spirit to the hearts  of the students.  It is not uncommon to  hear a student say, “ I can’t wait to see what the Lord is going to do in  Chapel this week!”</p>
                                <p><br />
                                  The entire campus community is encouraged to spend time daily  in prayer and personal devotions.   WEBC&amp;S offers many opportunities for the students and staff to get  together every week and seek the face of the Lord both at WEBC and Family Worship   Center, as well as in the  residence halls.</p>
                        <p><br />
                                  WEBC students have the opportunity to participate and  be blessed in the Easter and Thanksgiving Camp meetings as well as the highly  anticipated International Youth Conferences.   One thing is for sure, ministry opportunities abound for the WEBC  student.</p>

                           	  <p align="left"><span class="padding5"><img src='images/LL.png' alt="Loren Larson" width="327" height="174" border="0" align="middle" class="image margin3" /></span></p>
                              <p>The knowledge of the Word of God should be of paramount  concern to every Christian.  If a  believer desires to enhance his understanding of God and the ways of God, the  Bible is the only appropriate source that  need be studied.  We believe that all the  answers to life’s complexities are found within the confines of Scripture.  The keys of experiencing the “abundant life” that Jesus has promised is found within  the Bible.  It is a mystery to me why any believer would not desire to understand or study this  great Book. <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Here at WEBC we focus primarily on the study of the  Scriptures.  The classes themselves are  either an overview or an in-depth study of some portion of the Word.  The classes that are not exegetical studies  of the Word use the Bible as their primary source.  In the classes themselves, the Spirit of God  works in the lives of the students to drive home truth.  At times, the moving of the Spirit will  completely take over the class and the students will begin to praise, cry,  pray, and worship the One they are studying about.  It is in this atmosphere that true spiritual  growth can best occur.<br />
  <br />
                                  Whether you are interested in being here for a semester or  for the entire four-year program, I know that a great opportunity for spiritual  maturity will be extended to you.  You  may feel called to full-time ministry or perhaps you just want to spend a year  in a strong Bible program before going on to another institution.  In either case, WEBC will serve you  well, teaching you and encouraging you in your personal relationship with the  Lord.<br />
  <br />
                              I believe that men and women of God who know the Word of God  are vital to fulfill God’s present and future plans for His Church.  If the Lord is leading you to be a part of  WEBC, please don’t push that “call” away.  We will do  everything possible to help you fulfill the call or function that God has  designed just for you.  So come “renew your mind” with the Word of  God and discover for yourself what is that“good,  and perfect, and acceptable will of God” for you.</p>
