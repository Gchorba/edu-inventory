          <h2 class="style2">TODAY IS A LATE START SNOW DAY for Provo School District</h2>
          <p>
          Due to the amount of snow on the roads, We are declaring a Late Start Snow Day. For more information, see the procedures below.
          </p>
          </center> 
          -->
          <!--
          <h2>Late Start Day Information Announced</h2>
          <img src="img/news/psd-snowdaykidsphoto.jpg" alt="A photo of children in the snow" class="right" />
          <p>
		In anticipation of a heavy winter, Provo School District is working to prepare schools and patrons for what could possibly be a "snow day." To keep from having to make up days during Spring Break, Provo School District will avoid closing schools for a complete snow day, if at all possible. If a large storm does hit our city in the late evening or early morning, bus pick ups and school starting times may be set back exactly <strong>TWO</strong> hours later than the original times. This delayed start will give adequate time for snowplows to clear roads and ensure traveling is safe for all drivers in and around Provo City. </p>
          <p>For example: A school regularly starting at 8:00 a.m. will start at 10:00 a.m on a Late Start Day.  A regular bus pick up at 7:15 a.m. will be at 9:15 a.m on a Late Start Day.      </p>
          <p><strong>ALL</strong> schools, however, will keep dismissal times as originally scheduled.  Students will be released from school at the normally scheduled times they are accustomed to.</p>
          <p>If you are unsure of whether or not a storm has warranted a Late Start Day, please check this Provo School District Web site for updated information regarding the status of the school day.  If a notice has not been posted by 6:00 a.m., schools and bus routes will operate on the standard schedule.  Please check your local television news stations or contact Laken Cannon at 801-228-7802 if you do not have television or Internet access in your home.</p>
          <p>Please contact your school for more details regarding the Late Start Day. Thank you for helping your student understand these procedures. District: 801-374-4800. Transportation: 801-374-4860.</p>
          <h4>Heavy Snow Procedures for School Bus Transportation</h4>
          <p><strong>Below Bench Pick-up:</strong> If the roads have not been plowed or the snow accumulation on the roads is too deep the school bus will meet you at the following stop in your area as close to your regular stop time as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>Late Start:</strong> (Late starts are rare and are to be determined only by the Superintendent) If the Superintendent declares a late start day, due to snow, students will be picked up at the following stop in your area two hours after the regular stop time.</p>
          <p>Provo School District transportation will be in contact with Provo City plows to determine safety of roads before any decision is made. Please check this website or listen to KSL Weather for updates.</p>

          <h2>New Superintendent Announced </h2>
          <img src="img/news/psd-keith_rittell.png" alt="Photo of new Superintendent Keith Rittel" class="right"/>
          <p> The Provo School District Board of Education voted Keith C. Rittel as its next superintendent. Rittel currently serves as Deputy Superintendent of Clover Park School District in Lakewood (near Tacoma), Washington, a school district with a similarly-sized student population as the Provo School District.  Effective July 1, 2012, Rittel will succeed interim superintendent Robert Gentry and former superintendent Randall Merrill, who retired in January of this year.      </p>
          <p>&quot;It’s a great honor to have been chosen to lead Provo’s schools,&quot; said Rittel. &quot;The community and its resources are ideal for developing students.  Parent support is excellent.  I share the District’s vision for the future, and exceptional and diverse programs are in place.  I look forward to getting to know the people in the community and working to develop a long-term relationship with the fine educators and staff in the schools.&quot; </p>
          <p>&quot;Keith Rittel is a proven and successful leader of schools,&quot; said Kristine Manwaring, school board president.  &quot;He has a deep understanding about effective teaching and learning.  As a school board, we are delighted to welcome him to our community.&quot;</p>
          <p>Prior to his current position in Washington, Rittel served four years as principal at Kamiak High School in Mukilteo, Wash. and seven years as principal at Anacortes High School in Anacortes, Wash.  In 2004, he was honored as Washington State’s High School Principal of the Year.</p>
          <p>Before serving as principal, Mr. Rittel was an assistant principal at East High School in Salt Lake City and a teacher at Woods Cross High School in Woods Cross, Utah.  While at Woods Cross, he was the school’s nominee for the Davis County School District’s Teacher Hall of Fame recognition. Starting his teaching career in 1984, he also was a teacher in Prince George and Victoria in the Province of British Columbia. </p>
          <p>&quot;This has been an extensive and inclusive three-month process in reaching this decision,” said Manwaring.  &quot;Our superintendent selection committee included more than 25 members selected from among our educators and community.  The finalists went through four sets of interviews, including open houses.  Board members conducted extensive interviews of references at the sites of the candidates.&quot; Manwaring noted that student achievement is Rittel’s first priority.  &quot;He has led notable growth in student achievement in each of his leadership positions.  Teachers and administrators regard him as a highly-effective leader with strong instructional knowledge.&quot;</p>
          <p>Rittel received a bachelor’s degree from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., where he trained as a professional trombonist.  While working as an educator in Utah and completing a master’s degree in Educational Administration from the University of Utah, he performed frequently with the Utah Symphony and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  He has children and grandchildren in Utah.  He is also currently enrolled in a doctoral program at Seattle Pacific University.</p>

          <img src="img/news/best_of_state_medal.jpg" alt="Best of State graphic image" class="right"/>
          <p> The Provo School District Child Nutrition Program was chosen to receive the 2012 Best of State Award for being the top education support personnel group in Utah for the third consecutive year. This statewide award is given to outstanding businesses, programs, groups, or individuals. More than one hundred judges scrutinized the nominations for the Best of State Award.

          <h2>Lakeview Elementary Now Offering Portuguese Language Immersion</h2>
          <img src="img/news/lakeview-portuguese_sign-1.jpg" alt="Graphic of Portuguese flag" class="right"/>
          <p>Portuguese Dual Language Immersion will be available at Lakeview Elementary School starting Fall 2012. Provo School District is one of the first districts in Utah to offer Portuguese as an option for Dual Language Immersion instruction.   </p>
          <p>Provo School District’s Dual Language Immersion programs give elementary students the opportunity to become fluent in additional languages by the time they exit the sixth grade. Students enrolled in a Dual Language program will receive half of their daily instruction in English and the other half in the chosen target language. </p>
          <p>Ray Morgan, Provo School District Assistant Superintendent, is equally excited for the new addition to Provo’s Dual Immersion choices. &quot;We firmly believe that learning a second language impacts the overall learning capacity of our students,&quot; Morgan said. </p>
          <p>Portuguese is one of the four languages the state has promoted for Dual Immersion. Other languages at different Provo District elementary schools include Spanish, French and Mandarin Chinese. More than 40 years of research consistently documents the power of Immersion programs to help students attain high levels of second language proficiency. No other type of instruction, short of living in a second-language environment, is as successful.</p>
          <p>At the designated date, it will begin with students in first grade only.</p>
          <p>Lakeview Elementary was originally offering German Dual Immersion, but cuts were made to areas of the Dual Immersion program and German is no longer an option for schools desiring Dual Immersion.</p>

          <h2>Centennial Students “Go for the Gold” in Reading</h2>
          <p>Centennial Middle School students have been busily engaged in a reading competition at their school, &quot;Go for the Gold,&quot; during the third term.  Each Wolfpack (advisory/homeroom class) was challenged to win an ice cream sundae party by recording at least one book read by each student and teacher in the class.  Individual prizes were awarded to students who reached Bronze (10 books), Silver (20 books), and Gold (30 books) levels.  In addition, the three students who read the greatest number of books will be awarded grand prizes. As a school, Centennial students recorded a whopping 4,046 books read during third term.   </p>

          <h2>Dixon Students Read for Hope</h2>
          <img src="img/news/dixon-mali_fundraising.jpg" alt="Photo of Dixon students" class="right"/>
          <p>Seventh graders at Dixon Middle School have been turning books into bricks! In an ambitious effort to promote student literacy, cultivate global awareness, and encourage service-learning, Dixon’s English Department sponsored an initiative called Reading For Hope, a three week-long read-a-thon intended to raise funds to build a school in Mali, Africa, where nearly two-thirds of rural villages have no schools. Students have raised over $3,000 so far.  </p>
          <p>Participating students solicited pledges and donations from March 15th through the evening of April 4th, when they celebrated the generosity of students, families, community members, and business leaders in a cultural and literary event at Dixon’s Library. Representatives of the Utah-based Mali Rising Foundation were on hand to receive our donation, as well as education and community leaders.</p>
          <p>&quot;As English teachers, we couldn't be more pleased,&quot; says 7th grade teacher Lon Young. &quot;Our students devoured thousands of books. They reached out to their own community in getting pledges. There was something beautiful about watching them work so hard to help kids on the other side of the planet. Because it allows students into the mind and heart of another person, reading cultivates empathy. We see our students at Dixon turning that empathy into action as they set aside their own interests and serve others.&quot;</p>

          <p>Timpview High’s Math Team took first place at the Math Contest at Snow College.  Not only did they win, but the won by a very large margin.  Timpview students Yifeng Xu and Wayne Li (a freshman) also won first and second place respectively in the individual contests as well.   </p>
          <p>The Math Contest consisted of 40-question test that the students worked together on for two hours.  They only materials they can use include pencil, paper and their brains.  No calculators allowed.</p>
          <p>At the Contest, President White, President of Snow College, told the participants that no matter what they chose to do in life, learning mathematics and having fun with it, will best train their minds to think. The best thinkers are the ones who provide our country with the technological advances necessary to progress.</p>
          <p>Anne Crosland, a math teacher at Timpview and the Math Team’s faculty advisor, said, &quot;Mathematics is the best training for your brain and training your brain is never a waste of time.&quot;</p>
          <p>Congratulations to Yifeng Xu, Wayne Li, Amanda Gao, Peter Young, Jim Lu, Michael Christensen and Seong-Eun Cho for their remarkable performance! </p>

          <h2>Wasatch Students Study and Portray Notable Contributors to Society</h2>
          <img src="img/news/wasatch-wax_museum.jpg" alt="Photo of Wasatch students and wax objects" class="right"/>
          <p>Fifth-grade students at Wasatch Elementary put on the school’s annual Wax Museum, an event that encourages students to research the life and accomplishments of a certain individual that contributed to greater and common good for mankind.  Each student read a book about the person they wished to highlight or found other credible resources to gain information from. The students dressed up as their historical figure and even brought props to help illustrate more of whom they were representing.  They posed as still as they could, like a wax figure, unless someone came, pushed a &quot;button&quot; on their display, and the student then recited facts about their figure’s history and accomplishments.</p>
          <p>From Jim Henson to Annie Oakley, and from Henry Ford to Barack Obama, there was fantastic variety of notable characters that made a difference one way or another in history.  The students did a wonderful job conducting thorough research and worked hard to represent their subject in the best possible way.</p>

          <h2>Public Statement of the Board of Education of the Provo School District</h2>
          <p>As a result of  our staff’s internal investigations and of the State Office of Education Audit, which we requested, we have recently been presented with alarming information of financial irregularities, negligent and intentional failure to follow our policies and procedures, and violations of professional educator ethics and of State law in our District.  In some instances, internal financial controls must be strengthened.  In some areas, such as fundraising, our policies will require continuing review and revision.  When requested to do so in writing, as required by law, we have provided the requested records to the press.  We will continue to address all of the issues raised through the information we have received. </p>          
          <p>We have directed that our policies and procedures be carefully reviewed and improved as needed.  We will engage the assistance of independent auditors and legal counsel as necessary.  We demand and expect to be provided sufficient information to enable us to exercise appropriate financial oversight.  We will not tolerate in our staff and employees intentional and willful disregard of our established policies and procedures, of professional educator ethics, or of applicable State law.  We have directed our administrators to take immediate corrective disciplinary action in every instance where it is warranted, to ensure compliance and protect public funds and assets.</p>
          <p>We are painfully aware of the disciplinary action taken by our staff on March 13 and we regret it was found necessary by them to do so.  We respect the courage of our staff to take necessary disciplinary actions and we acknowledge our support of them as they follow our policies.</p>
          <p>Under our policy, individual personnel matters are confidential and we will not discuss them further in public.  All personnel matters will be handled and resolved according to our policies.  We acknowledge our employee’s rights to fairness and due process, which is provided by our policies.</p>

          <h2>Economic Downturn Affects District Budgets:  Provo Board of Education Seeks Input on Budget Reduction Options</h2>
          <img src="boe/img/board-dec08-small.jpg" alt="A photo of Timpview High Honors students" class="right" />
          <p>
          The State of Utah has not been immune to significant loss of revenue due to the global economic crisis.  Reductions in tax collections due to the poor economy will likely impact the ability of the Legislature to maintain current funding levels to schools in Provo City.
          </p>               
          <p>
          The Provo Board of Education encourages patrons to provide written input concerning options to reduce the budget in the likely event that reductions from the 2009 Utah State Legislature be enacted for the coming school year.
          </p>          
          <p>
          In early February 2009, the Legislature cut $900,000 of anticipated revenue to Provo City schools.  Last month, Provo School District reduced budgets by that amount.  It is anticipated that the District’s budget next school year could be reduced as much as 10% or approximately $6,000,000.  While we hope the cuts will not be that deep, each 1% reduction by the Legislature equals a $600,000 loss of revenue for the District, and the Board is wisely preparing for unprecedented budget reductions.
          </p>
          <p>
          The Board of Education has conducted two surveys related to patron desires for educational services for the City’s children, and is using the survey results when weighing options to balance the budget.  Items on the budget reduction list (link below) are <strong><em>options</em></strong> the Board is considering depending on the magnitude of the Legislative cuts.  The Board seeks input from the suggested options and any additional ideas patrons would like to share.  Your input will be shared with the Board in an upcoming study session.  <strong><em>Public input on proposed budget cuts closes February 23, 2009.</em> </strong>
