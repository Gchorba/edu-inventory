<div  class="paragraph editable-text" style=" display: block; "><br />Peoples College of Law is a small, fully licensed, degree-granting law school located in downtown Los Angeles, California offering a four-year evening Juris Doctorate program to accommodate working students.&nbsp;<br /><br />PCL was founded in 1974 as a non-profit (501(c)3 under the name The Guild Law School), community-run law school to bring legal resources to under-represented communities and train legal advocates to secure progressive social change and justice in society.&nbsp;<br /><br />We only admit those students who, regardless of their quite varied political, spiritual, cultural or social backgrounds, have demonstrated a commitment to progressive social change, have an awareness of working class issues and will employ the skills gained at the school to further these goals in their own way. <br /><br />Our graduates work as lawyers, state and federal administrative judges and commissioners, activists and union organizers, labor and legislative leaders. &nbsp;All have shared the unique and galvanizing experience of graduating from the only non-competitive, cooperative, student and community-run, progressive law school in the world!&nbsp;<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&nbsp;<br /><br /><EM>Disclosure Required by Guidelines for Unaccredited Law Schools<br /><br />Committee of Bar Examiners, State Bar of California, Effective January 1, 2008&nbsp;<br />The method of instruction at this law school for the Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree program is principally in physical classroom facilities.<br />Students enrolled in the J.D. degree program at this law school who successfully complete the first year of law study must pass the First-Year Law Students' Examination required by Business and Professions Code &sect; 6060(h) and Rule VIII of the Rules Regulating Admission to Practice Law in California as part of the requirements to qualify to take the California Bar Examination. A student who passes the First-Year Law Students' Examination within three (3) administrations of the examination after first becoming eligible to take it will receive credit for all legal studies completed to the time the examination is passed. A student who does not pass the examination within three (3) administrations of the examination after first becoming eligible to take it must be promptly disqualified from the law school's J.D. degree program. If the dismissed student subsequently passes the examination, the student is eligible for re-enrollment in this law school's J.D. degree program, but will receive credit for only one year of legal study.&nbsp;<br />Study at, or graduation from, this law school may not qualify a student to take the bar examination or to satisfy the requirements for admission to practice in jurisdictions other than California. A student intending to seek admission to practice law in a jurisdiction other than California should contact the admitting authority in that jurisdiction for information regarding the legal education requirements in that jurisdiction for admission to the practice of law.</EM>&nbsp; <br /><A title="" href="http://calbar.ca.gov/" target=_blank>California Bar</A><br /><br />PCL does not engage in discrimination against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, political affiliation, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran.<br /></div>
