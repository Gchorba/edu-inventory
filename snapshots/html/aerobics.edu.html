						<div class="entry-content shrink" name="4" style="overflow-y:hidden;">
							<p>With an increasingly large segment of the American population becoming overweight, it is becoming more and more important for Americans to learn about effective ways to exercise and remain fit. While other changes need to be made to an individual&#8217;s lifestyle in order for them to become fully fit and healthy, a good exercise regimen is a great starting point for returning to healthy ways. One of the best exercise regimens any individual can undertake to reverse the course of their health is aerobics.</p>
<p>The history of aerobics stretches back to the 1960s. A duo of professionals in the United States Air Force first began the study of aerobic exercise, creating the term &#8220;aerobic&#8221; and the exercise regimen itself. Dr. Kenneth Cooper and Colonel Pauline Potts were responsible for the birth of aerobics after Cooper was puzzled at the lack of ability among muscular individuals to perform at high intensities over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Cooper began testing the oxygen intake abilities of individuals using a bicycle ergometer. Individuals were tested based upon the ability of their body to use oxygen. Cooper&#8217;s results were published in 1968 in his book entitled &#8220;Aerobics.&#8221; Included in Cooper&#8217;s book were recommendations for exercise regimens involving swimming, jogging, running, and bicycling.</p>
<p>Many people assume that a fitness regimen designed to build muscle and improve performance is good enough to improve their all-around health. However, muscle building exercises are different from aerobic exercises. Muscle building exercise is considered anaerobic exercise as opposed to aerobic exercise. The difference between the two is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aerobic:</strong> This type of exercise is best performed at low to moderate intensity for longer periods of time</li>
<li><strong>Anaerobic:</strong> This type of exercise is best performed at moderate to high intensity for shorter periods of time</li>
</ul>
<p>While anaerobic exercise is designed to build muscle and prepare the body for short, intense bursts; aerobic exercise is designed to prepare the body to perform physical activities over much longer periods of time. There are many forms of exercise that fall into the category of aerobic exercise. The following are just a few examples of aerobic exercises that are commonplace in America:</p>
<p>Outdoors</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jogging</strong></li>
<li><strong>Running</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inline skating</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Indoors</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rowing machine</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stairmaster or stairclimber</strong></li>
<li><strong>Step aerobics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Water aerobics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Swimming</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>At Home</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zumba Dancing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Step aerobics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Jump rope</strong></li>
<li><strong>Kickboxing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Any individual is capable of performing any of the aerobics routines listed above. There is no limiting factor in performing these exercises other than an individual&#8217;s level of fitness. Even then, one of the things that make aerobics a great exercise option is the fact that it can be tailored to suit any individual. Those who lack the muscle strength and endurance to run for long distances can instead jog, putting less stress on their respiratory system and muscles. If a step aerobics class or Stairmaster is too high impact for older individuals, they can instead participate in a water aerobics class. These classes are in fact ideal for senior citizens because water supports the weight of the human body, removing stress on the joints and increasing range of motion.</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of aerobics an individual chooses to get involved with, the benefits remain the same. Aerobic exercise doesn&#8217;t just help people increase their ability to perform physical activities over long periods, it helps them achieve a healthier lifestyle overall. Some of the known benefits of aerobics include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthen the muscles involved in respiration</strong></li>
<li><strong>Facilitate better flow of air in and out of the lungs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strengthen and enlarging the heart muscle</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improve the pumping efficiency of the heart</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strengthen muscles throughout the body</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improve the efficiency of blood circulation, reducing blood pressure</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lower levels of stress</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reduce the risk for diabetes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Burn fat and build lean muscle.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Aerobic exercise cannot only be used as a method of improving one&#8217;s fitness level for the sake of health. It can also be used by athletes and those already in good shape to improve their performance levels as well. Athletes participating in endurance sports such as soccer, football, basketball, hockey, or cross country running can improve their performance levels through aerobic exercise. Benefits for performance include but are not limited to the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased storage of energy molecules, resulting in better endurance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increased blood flow through the muscles</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increased ability of muscles to use fats during exercise</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improved recovery time after intense exertion</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that aerobic exercise is not without its drawbacks. While increased performance and endurance are vital to many individuals, muscular strength is also important. Firefighters, policemen, soldiers, and athletes all need endurance, but they also require muscular strength to properly complete their jobs. Aerobic exercise is only a part of a well-balanced exercise regimen that challenges the body in numerous ways, encouraging not only physical growth, but also the ability to perform over the duration.</p>
