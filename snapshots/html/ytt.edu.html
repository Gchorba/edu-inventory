<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeshiva and 
Mesivta Torah Temimah is an educational institution that is an exponent of the 
Orthodox Jewish faith. Our educational philosophy and objectives are essentially 
functions of a value system that predates modern - and even ancient - history. 
The philosophical tenets of the school are rooted in the time-honored religio-moral 
values of Orthodox Judaism as they are refracted through the prism of the 
contemporary American democratic experience. We subscribe to the belief that 
scholarship, and indeed the learning process itself, is the <i>sine qua non</i> 
of our life's calling. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 6.0pt">
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our overall 
educational objectives focus primarily on developing the student both as an 
observant and believing practitioner of the Orthodox Jewish faith and as a 
budding scholar. Students are expected to be conversant with the classic works 
of Jewish scholarship, as well as an ethical and moral human being from the 
unique standpoint of the teachings of Jewish ethics and philosophy.&nbsp; In addition 
we seek to develop these students as educated individuals, providing them with 
the primary elements of classical and contemporary secular scholarship, 
including the sciences, mathematics, language arts and history.&nbsp; In brief, our 
objective is to develop a scholarly Orthodox Jew, who is at the same time a 
functioning and productive member of contemporary American democratic society, 
capable of facing the challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century and of 
benefiting from the promises of the American workplace and its economic 
environment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 6.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">These objectives are achieved 
through a combination of classical and contemporary curricula, ethical and moral 
standards, religious beliefs and practices, all with one goal in mind: 
empowering our students to function as Orthodox Jews in the American democratic 
and economic experience. </span></p>
