<h3>Budget Crisis Update</h3>
<p>Each year, the Superintendent seeks feedback from schools, district departments, the unions and the community. This input is used to develop a budget proposal based on the amount of funding it can expect from the state and other sources. Our Board of Education reviews the proposal, and, ultimately, decides whether or not to approve or amend it.</p>
