  <p class="bodycopy"><img src="images/caregivers.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /></p>
  <p class="bodycopy">(Robin Banks, Gwen Kauffman, Melissa Hamblin-Smith (Group Chair))</p>
  <p class="bodycopy">In the last couple of months, a new student group has formed at Davis to help those who are caregivers. The group is there to support each other because they understand how difficult it can be at times juggling school, life, and taking care of someone else. </p>
  <p class="bodycopy">This group helps them know they are not alone. Resources have been put together for everything from caring for elderly parents to autism to ADHD. One of the group members is happy to do research for the students. A caregiver resource area has been set aside in the Resource Center for any student who would like to learn more about various disabilities, illnesses, or help that is out there for caregivers.</p>
  <p class="bodycopy"> If you are interested in finding out more about this group, please contact Melissa Hamblin-Smith at hamblinsmithmel@daviscollege.edu. If you need some research done, please contact Gwen Kauffman at gkauffman@daviscollege.edu.  This group is open to current students as well as alumni.<br />
