                  <blockquote>
                    <p align="left">M. W. Bud Perrine is an internationally recognized authority on the impairing effects of alcohol, especially in injury accidents, as well as on the relationship between alcohol and violence / aggression. </p>
                    <p align="left">An Experimental and Behavioral Psychologist by training, Dr. Perrine is the scientist who has conducted the research other alcohol experts and toxicologists cite – most often in cases in which the Plaintiff has consumed alcohol and then suffered quadriplegia in swimming pool or other types of diving accidents. Dr. Perrine developed his expertise on the impairing effects of alcohol on diving as an outgrowth from his primary area of scientific investigation: the role of alcohol-impaired performance in vehicle crashes, with injury resulting. </p>
                    <p align="left">Dr. Perrine's career combines teaching, research, peer-reviewed publications, training, and government service. His Background Statement for Appearance as a Public and Expert Witness summarizes his credentials. Further, he has provided expert witness testimony and assistance in more than 50 legal cases throughout the United States. Many of those cases have concluded in settlement, following his reports, affidavits, and / or deposition testimony. <br>

                  <blockquote>
                    <p align="left"><strong>What if the Plaintiff's blood alcohol concentration is under .08? </strong></p>
                    <p align="left">Research has shown that large amounts of alcohol in the blood (both whole blood and serum) significantly impair a person's ability to operate vehicles safely. Dr. Perrine can show from his own research, however, that <strong>small amounts of alcohol </strong>also have impairing effects on a person's ability to discern and react to potential dangers, such as those at backyard pool parties and on the road at night. </p>
                    <p align="left"><strong><br>
                Isn't a toxicologist a better choice for testimony 
                about blood alcohol<br>
                       
                concentration? </strong></p>
                    <p align="left">Some toxicologists can testify to the technical facts of a person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC), but they are typically not qualified to address the specific kind of <strong>actual behavior </strong> that would have been impaired prior to or during the time of the injury accident, or the kind associated with particular BACs. </p>
                    <p align="left">Dr. Perrine is uniquely qualified to testify to the special circumstances of a person's <strong>behavior </strong> prior to and at the moment of the injury accident. That is, after taking into consideration a person's measured BAC at the time of the blood draw or breath test, gender, total body water, testimony regarding the events preceding the accident, and other relevant factors, Dr. Perrine can describe the impairment of specific behavioral characteristics of the person that would have prevailed at the time of the accident. These characteristics include the person's ability to judge distance, depth, and speed; to pay attention to warning signs; and to be aware of potential dangers. </p>
                    <p align="left"><strong><br>
                Wouldn't a low blood alcohol concentration at the time 
                of the 
                injury indicate <br>
                that alcohol played no role in the diving accident? </strong></p>
                    <p align="left">The Vermont Alcohol Research Center 's landmark experiment on the effects of alcohol consumption on recreational diving shows that significant risk of serious injury is present after as few as 2 drinks (0.04%). </p>
                    <p align="left"><strong><br>
                The Plaintiff was partying the night before, but by the 
                time 
                the diving accident <br>
                occurred, his BAC was zero (0.00%). 
                Could alcohol have played any part in <br>
                his injury? </strong></p>
                    <p align="left">When BACs are 0.00%, it is easy to assume that the diver is sober and unaffected by alcohol. However, a body of scientific research shows that residual effects of alcohol (including so-called hangover effects) can significantly impair skilled performance. </p>
                    <p align="left"><strong><br>
                All we should need is a laboratory scientist, like a toxicologist, who can offer <br>
                his opinion regarding the Plaintiff's BAC at the time of the diving accident. </strong></p>
                    <p align="left">Relying on the testimony of a toxicologist at trial permits only one determination regarding alcohol: Standard backward calculations of the Plaintiff's BAC at the time of the accident. However, a skillful Plaintiff's attorney will ask the next, obvious questions: (1) How and to what extent would that BAC affect the Plaintiff's decision to dive? And (2) How and to what extent would that BAC affect the Plaintiff's behavior just prior to his dive and during his dive? A toxicologist typically does not qualify as an expert to address the relationship between alcohol and behavior, or between alcohol and judgment, let alone alcohol and diving performance.</p>
